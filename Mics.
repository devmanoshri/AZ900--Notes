1. You have an Azure virtual network named VNET1 in a resource group named RG1.
You assign an Azure policy specifying that virtual networks are not an allowed resource type in RG1. VNET1 is
deleted automatically?

Yes, deleted automatically.
Continues to function normally
Is now a read-only object
Ans. 

The VNet will be marked as ‘Non-compliant’ when the policy is assigned. However, it will not be deleted and will continue to function normally.
Azure Policy is a service in Azure that you use to create, assign, and manage policies. These policies enforce different rules and effects over your resources, so those resources stay compliant with your corporate standards and service level agreements.
If there are any existing resources that aren’t compliant with a new policy assignment, they appear under Non-compliant resources.
