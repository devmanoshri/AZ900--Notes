1. You have an Azure virtual network named VNET1 in a resource group named RG1.
You assign an Azure policy specifying that virtual networks are not an allowed resource type in RG1. VNET1 is
deleted automatically?

Yes, deleted automatically.
Continues to function normally
Is now a read-only object
Ans. 

The VNet will be marked as ‘Non-compliant’ when the policy is assigned. However, it will not be deleted and will continue to function normally.
Azure Policy is a service in Azure that you use to create, assign, and manage policies. These policies enforce different rules and effects over your resources, so those resources stay compliant with your corporate standards and service level agreements.
If there are any existing resources that aren’t compliant with a new policy assignment, they appear under Non-compliant resources.

2.   

Conditional Access is a feature that Microsoft Entra uses to allow or deny access to resources based on identity signals, such as the device being used. 

SSO enables a user to sign in one time and use that credential to access multiple resources and applications from different providers. 

MFA is a process whereby a user is prompted during the sign-in process for an additional form of identification. 

Hybrid identity solutions create a common user identity for authentication and authorization to all resources, regardless of location.

3. Azure RBAC allows you to assign a set of permissions to a user or group. Resource tags are used to locate and act on resources associated with specific workloads, environments, business units, and owners. Resource locks prevent the accidental change or deletion of a resource. Key Vault is a centralized cloud service for storing an application secrets in a single, central location.

4.A defense in depth strategy uses a series of mechanisms to slow the advancement of an attack that aims to gain unauthorized access to data. The principle of least privilege means restricting access to information to only the level that users need to perform their work. A DDoS attack attempts to overwhelm and exhaust an application's resources. The perimeter layer is about protecting an organization's resources from network-based attacks.

5. After an outage, Service Health provides official incident reports called root cause analysis (RCA), which you can share with stakeholders.
6. Agility means that you can deploy and configure cloud-based resources quickly as app requirements change. Scalability means that you can add RAM, CPU, or entire virtual machines to a configuration. Elasticity means that you can configure cloud-based apps to take advantage of autoscaling, so apps always have the resources they need. High availability means that cloud-based apps can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime, even when things go wrong.
7. Which type of strategy uses a series of mechanisms to slow the advancement of an attack that aims to gain unauthorized access to data?

8. Which Microsoft Entra feature can you use to ensure that users can only access Microsoft Office 365 applications from approved client applications?

Conditional Access

Conditional Access allows administrators to control, allow, or deny access to resources based on certain signals. You can require that access to certain applications only be allowed if the users are using an approved client application. MFA is a process whereby a user is prompted during the sign-in process for an additional form of identification. Examples include a code on their mobile phone or a fingerprint scan.

9. An administrator needs to run a script written in PowerShell. This script is going to create a virtual machine in Azure. Would the script run on a computer that runs Linux and has the Azure CLI tools installed?
Ans. No. A PowerShell script is a file that contains PowerShell cmdlets and code. A PowerShell script needs to be run in PowerShell.
PowerShell can now be installed on Linux. However, the question states that the computer has Azure CLI tools, not PowerShell installed. Therefore, this solution does not meet the goal.

10. Azure Cognitive Services is a collection of ready-to-use artificial intelligence (AI) APIs that allow developers to incorporate advanced AI capabilities into their projects. These services provide features such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, machine translation, and more.

11. Azure Application Insights is an extensible analytics service that helps you understand the performance and usage of your live web application. Connect to your Application Insights resource to run and visualize various Analytics queries.

12. Resources don't inherit the tags you apply to a resource group or a subscription. 

13. You cannot merge two subscriptions into a single subscription.

14. You are charged for public IP addresses. Therefore, deleting unused public IP addresses will reduce the Azure costs.

15. A company is planning on migrating all of their on-premise servers to Azure. Their business continuity department has advised that they need to ensure that servers hosted in Azure are available even if an Azure Data Center were to go down. Which of the following is a concept that would be involved in the design stage for this requirement.
a. Fault Tolerance.

16. Your team needs to have an integrated solution in place that can be used for the deployment of code. Which of the following service can be used for this purpose?
a. Azure DevOps.

17. After an outage, Service Health provides official incident reports called root cause analysis (RCA), which you can share with stakeholders.

18. Azure Monitor is a platform that collects metric and logging data, such as CPU percentages. The data can be used to trigger autoscaling.

19. Health advisories are issues that require that you take proactive action to avoid service interruptions, such as service retirements and breaking changes. Service issues are problems such as outages that require immediate actions.

20. Service endpoints are used to expose Azure services to a virtual network, providing communication between the two. ExpressRoute is used to connect an on-premises network to Azure. NSGs allow you to configure inbound and outbound rules for virtual networks and virtual machines. Peering allows you to connect virtual networks together.

21. A defense in depth strategy uses a series of mechanisms to slow the advancement of an attack that aims to gain unauthorized access to data. The principle of least privilege means restricting access to information to only the level that users need to perform their work. A DDoS attack attempts to overwhelm and exhaust an application's resources. The perimeter layer is about protecting an organization's resources from network-based attacks.

22. Spot instances are a type of cloud computing resource available at steep discounts(great discounts) compared to traditional on-demand rates. They represent unused computing power that a cloud service provider wants to sell off at a lower price to ensure maximum utilization of its resources.

23. Lock inheritance
When you apply a lock at a parent scope, all resources within that scope inherit the same lock. Even resources you add later inherit the same parent lock.

24. Premium Storage is specifically designed for Azure Virtual Machine workloads requiring consistent high performance and low latency. This makes them highly suitable for I/O-sensitive SQL Server workloads. Premium Storage is currently available only for storing data on disks used by Azure Virtual Machine
