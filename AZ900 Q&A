14.What affect does using a "read only" resource lock on a Azure Storage Account have?
A. The storage account cannot have its properties altered but it doesn't affect the data itself.

Resource Locks only affect your ability to make changes to a resource within Azure but do not affect the resource itself. For instance, a resource lock on a virtual machine still allows the VM to operate but will prevent someone from restarting a VM. Similarly, a resource lock on a storage account only affects the Azure properties of the account.
